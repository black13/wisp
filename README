See the user guide in doc/ for complete information on Wisp. If
AsciiDoc and SCons is installed, you can build it with "scons". Or you
can just look at the very readable documentation source text.

If you just want to see it without poking around documentation, you
can build it right now by running "scons" here. Then simply execute
wisp. Try it with rlwrap for better command line editing.

See INSTALL for quick info on installing Wisp.
