See the user guide in doc/ for complete information on Wisp. You can
buil it with "make doc".

If you just want to see it without poking around documentation, you
can build it right now by running make here. Then simply execute
wisp. Try it with rlwrap for better command line editing.

See INSTALL for quick info on installing Wisp.
